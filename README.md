### Running Tests

Our application includes comprehensive tests to ensure everything works correctly:

1. Create a SQLite database file for testing:

    ```bash
    touch database/database.sqlite
    ```

2. Configure your `.env.testing` file to use SQLite:

    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite
    ```

3. Run the test suite:

    ```bash
    php artisan test
    ```

    For more detailed output:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox
    ```

The test suite includes:

-   Unit tests for calculator operations
-   Feature tests for API endpoints
-   Integration tests for the full application

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup:

-   **Database Connection Issues**: Ensure your database credentials are correct in the `.env` file
-   **Composer Dependencies**: Try running `composer dump-autoload` if classes aren't found
